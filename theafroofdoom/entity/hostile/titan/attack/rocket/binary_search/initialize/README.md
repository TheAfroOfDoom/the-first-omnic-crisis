# initialize
Files for initialize's binary search algorithm.
    
### *.mcfunction*s:
    - 0_1: Splits 0 and 1 rotations and redirects Titans to their corresponding initialize function.

    - 0_3: Splits 0-1 and 2-3 rotations and continues down the BST.
    
    - 0_7: Splits 0-3 and 4-7 rotations and continues down the BST.

    - 2_3: Splits 2 and 3 rotations and redirects Titans to their corresponding initialize function.

    - 4_5: Splits 4 and 5 rotations and redirects Titans to their corresponding initialize function.

    - 4_7: Splits 4-5 and 6-7 rotations and continues down the BST.

    - 6_7: Splits 6 and 7 rotations and redirects Titans to their corresponding initialize function.
