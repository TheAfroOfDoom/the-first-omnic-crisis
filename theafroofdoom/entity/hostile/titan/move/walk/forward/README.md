# forward
Dictates animations, sounds, and mechanics for the Titan Walk Forward movement ability.

### *.mcfunction*s:
    - initialize: Initializes scores and tags for the Titan Walk Forward ability.
    
## binary_search
Utilizes a binary search algorithm to efficiently determine which to function to run depending on the Forward Walking Titan's rotation score.

## final_step
Similar to "end_of_loop" mcfunctions, dicates what the Titan does on its final step forward depending on its rotation score.

## first_step
Dictates animations, sounds, and mechanics for the Titan Walk Forward movement ability during its first step forward.

## step
Dictates animations, sounds, and mechanics for the Titan Walk Forward movement ability during its steps after the first and before the final one.
