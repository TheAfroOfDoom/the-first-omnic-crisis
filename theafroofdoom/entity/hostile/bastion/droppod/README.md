Functions for the Bastion Droppod.

A funny aside - I had tweeted [@PlayOverwatch](https://twitter.com/TheAfroOfDoom/status/850838604981174273) asking if there had been any Omnic Droppod models in lore anywhere since I couldn't find any and wanted to develop this.  ***Literally the next day***, the Uprising event came out and with it the Omnic Droppods were revealed.
