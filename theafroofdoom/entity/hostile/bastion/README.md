The Minecraft version is heavily under-modelled because of technicalities with the ability to remodel/retexture entities.  It is a heavily retextured skeleton (wearing the Bastion Head model):

I did fully model an actual Bastion, but due to technical limitations with the game (not being able to set a body model, only a head model) I downgraded it to the skeleton form. | ![](https://i.imgur.com/fu44t0R.png)
